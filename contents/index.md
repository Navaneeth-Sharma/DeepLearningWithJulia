Deep Learning with Julia is a book about how to do various deep learning tasks using the Julia programming language and specifically the Flux.jl package. The intent of the book is to prove that serious deep learning can be done in Julia and that the ecosystem as a whole is ready for the spotlight. 

You can find the code for this website [on GitHub](https://github.com/logankilpatrick/DeepLearningWithJulia).
