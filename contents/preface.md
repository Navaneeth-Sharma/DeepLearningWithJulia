# Preface {#sec:preface}

The world is undergoing a radical shift. Machine Learning (and specifically Deep Learning) uses are being accelerated across every industry and domain. Humans have unlocked a significant new tool, the likes of which has not been seen since the software explosion took place in the early 2000's. But what does this mean for developers and those interested in working with these tools?

Like many field in the technology industry, there is a great deal of gate keeping in the Machine Learning community. Those in positions of power often make it seem as though using and understanding machine learning is reserved for those with PhD's and years of experience. This could not be farther from the truth. As the use of machine learning has increased, the barrier to entry have been slowly torn down. The result is that students with minimal programming and machine learning experience can now enter into the field and make advancements on the current state of the art.

In this book, we will touch on:
- What the Julia Programming Language is and why we will be using it
- What Deep Learning is
- Various applications of Deep Learning

## Why Deep Learning? {#sec:why_deep_learning}

Why are we focusing on Deep Learning? How is that any different than machine learning? These are both great questions. We will delve more into the details in chapter 2, but the quick answer is that deep learning is a specific machine learning technique and the reason we want to focus on it is that many of the advancements as well as applications you have read about under the "AI" or "Machine Learning" title, are actually deep learning solutions under the hood. Use cases like Self Driving cars, digital voice assistants, recommendation engines (like on YouTube and Netflix) are all powered by Deep Learning.

## Why does this book exist? {#sec:book_motivation}

What was the point of writing this book? Currently, almost all deep learning uses Python. Given the popularity of the language, this is a natural choice, especially given the prevalence of high quality libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow, Pytorch, etc. However, as the Julia programming language continues to grow and gain adoption, there is a rather wide gap. While we have Flux.jl for deep learning in Julia, there are not currently any resources for learning about deep learning in Julia. Conversely, in the Python ecosystem, there are at least 4-5 foundational deep learning books which I personally used during my learning journey and I found to be excellent. The goal for this book is to show people that doing deep learning in Julia is a viable choice and more so than that, could actually come with significant advantages over other languages.

## Acknowledgements

I could write an entire book itself just going through all of the folks who have helped me get here. In general, this book, my career and life, are a product of support from a large group of amazing folks. From my parents and family, to teachers and professors, and especially the Julia community, without which, there would be no one reading this text. I will save you all from the rest of the sappy narrative but know that I appreciate each and every person who helped me get here.
